# Hexahedral-Meshing-and-Structural-Analysis-of-a-Car-Bumper-Using-Altair-HyperMesh
Developed a high-quality hexahedral mesh for a car bumper using Altair HyperMesh. Focused on precise geometry cleanup, meshing, and quality checks to ensure accurate structural and crash simulations. Improved analysis reliability by minimizing skewness and enhancing element continuity.
